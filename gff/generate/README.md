# Generating a dataset

This module contains functions for generating the dataset. It is broken into three phases: selecting basins (`./basins.py`), searching for S1 images with `asf_search` (`./search.py`), and finally running models on those S1 images to create floodmaps (`./floodmaps.py`).

The scripts for generating the dataset are kept elsewhere.
